                    <li>Green symbolizes permission granted, indicating that a student has been granted approval to leave the classroom for a designated purpose.</li>
                    <li>When students see the green pass on their device, they know they have the go-ahead to proceed with their planned activity, whether it's using the restroom, visiting the library, or attending a scheduled appointment.</li>
